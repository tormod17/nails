# Nails fe-test tanget.

# Stack

- Bootstrap v4 grid.
- Vanilla Javascript.
- SASS (gulpfile inc - in root of project just type 'gulp').

# Progress

I have published my finished result on gh-pages.
Decided to go with sass as it's always nicer to write and read as well as less painful with prefixes. 
As per task set I didn't spend time on icons, fonts, color or copy. Took a very quick approach to thi. 
As per missing pictures I cropped from the layout provided, and made use of those. 
Decided to do the slide show with vanilla javascript as it wouldn't show you any javascript knowledge if I had just used the Bootstrap Carousel. 

# Hurdles

- First problem I had with this test was with the overlaping telegraph page, Whilst I caould get it to overlap, also getting it to be responsive was tricky. I decided in mobile view this wasn't necessary. 
- Second problem I had was making the slide show responsive, in retro spective I would have built the whole thing in javascript 
dynamically creating the html elements and inserting them.  Decided not to as I would need to know the width of the images before they are rendered. 

# Further Iteration. 

- Could have provided tests for the app.js. 
- Paid more attention to colors by using a color picker, by opening the pdf in my browser. 
- Slider could be improved by adding a safety for clicking while the images are sliding. 
- Hamburger Button, could have animated the svg paths on hover. 
- Addition of a button to scroll back to the top of the page int the bottom right corner.
